# 60GHz Wireless Receiver Design

I had the opportunity at Columbia to study under Harish Krishnaswamy, who is something of a legend in the RF IC design space. His research outfit, the Columbia High-Speed and Millimeter-Wave Integrated Circuits Lab (CoSMIC) has made some pretty astonishing advances in EHF IC design which enabled the 5G revolution in the early 2020s. Under his guidance I 

### The Future of mmWave
As natural as it seems that we should keep pushing wireless communication bands to higher frequencies, my experience on this project has made me wonder whether the technology is plateauing in terms of usefulness.
