Thanks for stopping by! 

I'm an electrical and computer engineer interested in analog integrated circuit design, embedded systems, and real-time systems. I graduated from Columbia in 2025 with an M.S.E.E. focused on analog IC, and previously worked at Speedgoat as an Application Support Engineer.

I'm also interested in guitar, songwriting, and painting.
