# Successive Approximation Register Analog-Digital Converter (i.e., SAR ADC)

The SAR architecture (or SARchitecture, if you will) appeals to the computer science purist in me because it operates as a physical implementation of a binary search algorithm. Furthermore, it is quite mathematically elegant. The exact number of steps needed for a given conversion is easily determined, and with careful design, the exact timing of each conversion step too.
