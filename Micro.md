# 8-bit Microcontroller in 45nm CMOS

VLSI Adventures. 

*8-bit accumulator-based core with 6-bit instruction word and 3-bit opcode*

Compared to modern microprocessor architectures, this design is extremely simple. Despite this, as a new grad student doing my first VLSI layouts I found the learning curve to be steep. 

*Components*:
	Memory (implemented as SRAM)
	Accumulator
	Shifter 
	Full Adder (Carry-lookahead)
	Decoder
